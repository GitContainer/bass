ECG-Python and GHRV protocol

Dependencies:
Enthought’s distribution of Python (canopy): https://store.enthought.com/

Optional components (recommended for full feature set):
pyEEG: http://pyeeg.sourceforge.net/
gHRV: http://milegroup.github.io/ghrv/index.html

Protocol
A. Python
1. Open ipython notebook: 
	a. open terminal window
	b. type “ipython notebook” -> Enter
	c. the notebook should launch automatically in a web browser window. make sure that the window is not internet explorer (chrome is ideal). if the page doesn’t load, look for the line in the terminal window that reads: ‘The IPython Notebook is running at: http://###.#.#.#:8888/‘. You can copy and paste the address into the address bar of your web browser.
	d. do not launch from Canopy! 
	e. Navigate through your folder tree to where you have saved the SWAN.ipynb file. Click on it to open it.

****To run code blocks: click on the block then press the play button at the top of the page OR hit Shift + Enter.****

2. Click in code block [1]  Shift + Enter  
	a. You should see “Load Successful!” outside the bottom of the code block

	3. In code block [2]
		a. Input the file path to the recording you want to analyze
		ex. /Users/File/Location/file.txt
		b.  Shift + Enter
	4. In code block [3]
		a. On path = line input where the data will be saved
		b. folder = name of the folder where files will be saved. This has to already exist!
		c.  Shift + Enter
	5.  Shift + Enter through [4], [5], and [6]
a. In code block [5] you will need to determine the savitzky_golay number that works best for your data. In this notebook it is set to 101
	5. Peak Detect [7]
a. You can change delta. If you make the delta larger few events will detected and visa versa.  
b.  Shift + Enter
	6. Burst Detect [10]
a. You can change thresphprec (make higher if catching events that aren’t bursts) and cluserperc. 
		b.  Shift + Enter
	7. Save file for GHRV
a. Before code block [14] you will  Shift + Enter and it will automatically save files to be opened into gHRV. You can choose to open the ttot (distances between each burst start time) or rr
	10. Save all files 
	11. Run through Poincare and Line Plots
		a. Save files as pdf 
B. GHRV
	1. Open using terminal window
		a. python/usr/share/ghrv/python ghrv.py
	2. Under heart rate data (not new project)
		a. Load either the ttot or rr file saved earlier
		
	3. Under Projects
a. Change settings
b.  60second window, 30 second shift 
	4. Interpolate
	5. Frame based evolution
		a. check power and apEN  refresh
		b. click save button  save as PDF
c. From Frame Based Evolution Screen Export as text (must add GHRV or other identifier to file name to avoid duplicate files)
			a. Select all bands
b. Separation character   tab or ,
		d. Close frame based evolution
	6. Generate full report (click report)   save as Html ( add fullreport to the file name)
	DONE!
